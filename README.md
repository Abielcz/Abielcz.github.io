### Professional Assessment
Since beginning my Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University in 2021, Iâ€™ve developed a strong foundation in data structures, algorithms, software design, and database systems. My portfolio highlights growth across each of these areas through real-world projects and technical enhancements.

These artifacts demonstrate:
- Proficiency in transitioning between programming languages (e.g., Java to Python).
- Optimization of code efficiency and system performance.
- Implementation of secure and maintainable database solutions.
- Professional communication through code reviews and team collaboration.
  
My work not only reflects technical competency but also a growing ability to adapt to development environments and problem-solve effectively.
