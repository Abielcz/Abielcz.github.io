### Professional Self Assessment
I have been in the computer science program at Southern New Hampshire University since 2021 shortly after graduating high school. This journey has been transformative in the way I perceive technology and has equipped me with a comprehensive understanding of data structures, algorithms, software engineering, database management, and security. From the enhancements made to the projects within this digital portfolio to projects like the CS-330 Computer Graphics and Visualization, my strengths with these skills have been demonstrated. Other classes in the program have also introduced me to collaborating in a team environment and how to effectively communicate with stakeholders which are important skills in the computer science field and something I previously lacked. The projects in this ePortfolio have shown me just how much I have learned in the course of the program, things like transferring coding languages, working with MySQL, and enhancing time complexity are just some of the skills. Working through these courses and projects has allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of computer science and has improved my employability in the field as my skills set me apart from others. The two artifacts in this ePortfolio, the IT 145: Foundation in Application Development final project and the DAD 220: Introduction to SQL final project, will reflect my growth throughout this course and will demonstrate the full range of my computer science abilities.

### Code Review
Code review is an important aspect of developing software as it finds errors, improves code quality, and shares knowledge with other team members. Creating a code review for my artifacts effectively helped me find what I needed to work on and allowed me to enhance my code in many aspects. As my code review is too big to be uploaded to GitHub Pages I have included a link below.

### Software Design and Engineering Enhancement
The artifact I chose for this category of enhancement is the IT 145: Foundation in Application Development project. This artifact is a Java program for rescue animals that allows users to add animal information to the system, show the animals in the system, and set them as reserved if needed. The artifact is used for dogs and monkeys as of right now and gathers information like name, animal type, training status, and in service country. The original code was made with Java, had insufficient commenting, and had issues functioning as it had improper syntax and spelling of variables.

**List of enhancements made:**

1. Transferred langauge from Java to Python.
2. Improved syntax in “reserveAnimal” method, “printAnimal” methods, and “RescueAnimal” class.
3. Corrected Indentation throughout the entire code.
4. Included comments with intent and decision of the functionality throughout the code.
5. Removed leftover or commented out code.
6. Corrected Spelling of variables like the "InServiceCountry" variable.
7. Included Error Handling in areas where user input isn't accepted.


**Outcome Met:**

Through these enhancements I have demonstrated an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals by completing the following enhancements.


**Narative:**

The decision to include this artifact within my ePortfolio was made easy as this work can show many programming skills and abilities while not being overly complex to understand. The use of classes and inheritance in my code shows skills and understanding in object-oriented design. My ability in working with collections in Java is shown by my use of Array Lists. The use of a “Scanner” object shows my knowledge in user input and handling. Code readability is apparent in the entirety of my code as it's organized with classes and methods. All of these skills I have used show an understanding in software development. I have improved this code by transferring the language from Java to Python and enhancing the overall logic in many areas like the “reserveAnimal” method, “printAnimal” methods, and “RescueAnimal” class. The syntax in these areas were also improved. I have ensured the code has correct indentation, comments, and follows proper coding standards. Left over and commented out code was removed and the variables in the code were corrected for spelling and usage like static or instance. Error handling was included in the code as well. All of this was done to improve the overall readability, maintainability, and functionality while showcasing my skills in software development as mentioned in my Code Review. The process of enhancing the artifact allowed me to realize the amount of coding skills I have learned since making this artifact in 2021 as I could instantly see some of the errors within it. I was able to fix many of the mistakes and areas of improvement with my current knowledge in Java programming; yet some aspects regarding the logic I had no choice but to do research. Websites like "Stack Overflow” allowed me to see how others tackled similar issues and how they were able to fix it. Using that information and altering it for my case usage I was able to successfully fix some of the challenges in the code. With these enhancements I have shown my ability to use innovative skills and techniques for implementing design solutions and accomplishing my goals by transferring the language and by improving the syntanx, indentation, and overall readability.
