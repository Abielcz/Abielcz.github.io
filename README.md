### Professional Self Assessment
I have been in the computer science program at Southern New Hampshire University since 2021 shortly after graduating high school. This journey has been transformative in the way I perceive technology and has equipped me with a comprehensive understanding of data structures, algorithms, software engineering, database management, and security. From the enhancements made to the projects within this digital portfolio to projects like the CS-330 Computer Graphics and Visualization, my strengths with these skills have been demonstrated. Other classes in the program have also introduced me to collaborating in a team environment and how to effectively communicate with stakeholders which are important skills in the computer science field and something I previously lacked. The projects in this ePortfolio have shown me just how much I have learned in the course of the program, things like transferring coding languages, working with MySQL, and enhancing time complexity are just some of the skills. Working through these courses and projects has allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of computer science and has improved my employability in the field as my skills set me apart from others. The two artifacts in this ePortfolio, the IT 145: Foundation in Application Development final project and the DAD 220: Introduction to SQL final project, will reflect my growth throughout this course and will demonstrate the full range of my computer science abilities.
