- Improved maintainability, readability, and user experience.


**Narrative:**

The decision to include this artifact within my ePortfolio was made easy as this work can show many programming skills and abilities while not being overly complex to understand. The use of classes and inheritance in my code shows skills and understanding in object-oriented design. My ability to work with collections in Java is shown by my use of ArrayLists. The use of a “Scanner” object shows my knowledge of user input and handling. Code readability is apparent in the entirety of my code as it's organized with classes and methods. All of these skills I have used show an understanding of software development. I have met the outcome of showcasing the ability to use innovative techniques, skills, and tools in this code by transferring the language from Java to Python and enhancing the overall logic in many areas, like the “reserveAnimal” method, “printAnimal” methods, and “RescueAnimal” class. The syntax in these areas was also improved. I have ensured the code has correct indentation, comments, and follows proper coding standards. Leftover and commented-out code was removed, and the variables in the code were corrected for spelling and usage, like static or instance. Error handling was included in the code as well. All of this was done to improve the overall readability, maintainability, and functionality while showcasing my skills in software development, as mentioned in my Code Review. Throughout the process of these enhancements, I also met the outcome of using strategies for building collaborative environments so that audiences support decision-making by adding in informational comments, which allow collaboration, and my collaborative efforts with my professor ensured decision-making was sufficient in my enhancements. The process of enhancing the artifact allowed me to realize the amount of coding skills I have learned since making this artifact in 2021, as I could instantly see some of the errors within it. I was able to fix many of the mistakes and areas of improvement with my current knowledge in Java programming; yet, for some aspects regarding the logic, I had no choice but to do research. Websites like "Stack Overflow” allowed me to see how others tackled similar issues and how they were able to fix them. Using that information and altering it for my case usage, I was able to successfully fix some of the challenges in the code. With these enhancements, I have shown my ability to use innovative skills and techniques for implementing design solutions and accomplishing my goals by transferring the language and improving the syntax, indentation, and overall readability.

### Algorithms & Data Structures
Project: Animal Rescue System (Enhanced)

[Original Java Project](IT_145_Original_Artifact_Abiel_Zamora.zip)


[Enhanced Python Project](CS-499_Enhancement_Two_Abiel_Zamora.zip)


![Dictionary Screenshot](Enhancement_2_Screenshot_Abiel_A_Zamora.png)


**List of enhancements made:**
- Replaced list-based storage with dictionary structures.

- Reduced time complexity from O(n) to O(1) for key operations.

- Streamlined algorithmic logic and added input validation.
   
**Outcome Met:**

I have designed and evaluated computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices by completing the following enhancements.


**Narrative:**

The decision to include this artifact within my ePortfolio was due to its ability to show my many programming skills and abilities. Many components of the artifact showcase my abilities in algorithms and data structures. For example, my replacement of lists for dictionaries in the code shows skills in improving time complexity as it optimized the operations in the system and resulted in increased data management. The use of input validation in the “reserve” method demonstrates knowledge in implementing algorithmic logic and making the system more efficient, as it prevents errors from forming in the system from incorrect information. Using object initialization in the code instead of combining everything under one Python file ensures better data management, maintainability, readability, and overall shows an understanding of data structure optimization. The artifact was improved by adding dictionary functions that use hash tables to optimize the system and time complexity. Another improvement was the addition of input validation in the system to handle any invalid inputs, as without it, errors could occur and lead to bigger problems that reduce the efficiency of the code. With this enhancement, I demonstrated skills in optimization, data management, and enhancing time complexity. This was done with my addition of dictionaries, input validation, and other enhancements. This enhancement focused on algorithmic principles and data structures to ensure efficiency at the cost of affecting some code readability within the project. Specifically, I improved the time complexity and optimization of adding, storing, and reserving new animals from O(n) to O(1) just by switching over from the list functionality to the dictionary functionality, as it uses a hash table, which allows the system to do quick searches. I have met the outcome of designing computing solutions that solve a problem using algorithmic principles and computer science standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs. I used algorithmic principles throughout the design of my code with my data structures, such as dictionaries and algorithms in the feature of managing the dogs and monkeys to enhance the project and solve issues like bad time complexity and optimization. Best standard practices were used throughout my work as I ensured everything was readable, maintainable, and consistent. Furthermore, I made sure to manage tradeoffs as previously mentioned by assessing what features may be negatively impacted by improving optimization, like the code readability being worse than before by the implementation of input validations and more. The process of enhancing the artifact allowed me to realize the amount of coding skills I have learned since making this artifact in 2021, as I could instantly see some of the errors within it. I was able to fix many of the mistakes and areas of improvement with my current knowledge in Python programming; yet, some aspects regarding the adding the implementation of HashMap, I had no choice but to do research. Websites like "Stack Overflow” allowed me to see how others tackled similar issues and how they were able to fix them. Using that information and altering it for my case usage, I was able to successfully fix some of the challenges in the code.

### Databases Enhancement
The artifact for the databases category is the DAD 220: Introduction to SQL project made sometime around 2022. It is a database that stores customer, order, and return information to allow a user to query or store data in it. This database is made with MySQL and is the first project I have made with this application.

**List of enhancements made:**
1. Included indexes.
2. Included triggers.
3. Removed duplicated or unused tables.
4. Included encryption of customer information.

**Outcome Met:**

I developed a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources by completing the following enhancements. 

I also demonstrated an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals by completing the following enhancements.

**Narrative:**

This artifact shows a wide range of skills with databases and will allow others to get an idea of my knowledge. I chose this artifact as it was a great way to showcase my skills with my planned enhancements, as when it was first made, it had many flaws and was very simple. Many components of this database showcase my skills, such as my knowledge of database design, which is apparent in my creation of the tables of customers, orders, and returns in the database. Skills in MySQL and querying are apparent, as many of those skills are used within the database to get any needed information, like the select statements used. Moreover, indexing and triggers in the work show an understanding of database optimization and automation within the system. The indexing is in the customers, orders, and returns tables, which allows users to easily find information based on specific data like last name, state, and order ID. The triggers are apparent in the customers and orders table and allow for the database to automatically store the time an update was made to an order or customer. Furthermore, the encrypted street address for the Customers table shows an understanding of security implementation within databases. I also cleaned up the database by removing tables that were not being used, removing duplicate tables, and changing the names of tables to make more sense within the database. The artifact was improved by the implementation of indexes, triggers, and encryption. These advanced concepts of SQL enhanced the overall efficiency of the database and allowed for a more secure environment. With these enhancements, I implemented more advanced concepts of SQL into my database with indexes, triggers, and encryption. I also met the outline of demonstrating the ability to use techniques or skills to deliver solutions of value, and the outline of developing a security mindset with my enhancements to the database. I met these outlines as I demonstrated my skills with advanced SQL concepts like indexing in multiple tables for improved efficiency, with the ability to quickly search based on the criteria. The outline was also met with the triggers for the orders and customers table to have automatic functionality with the timestamps. Finally, the outline was further met with the security aspect of including encryption within the customer information to ensure there is no unauthorized access and improve the overall security of the database. While enhancing this database, I learned that SQL has many advanced concepts I didn’t know. I faced many challenges with not being able to add as many triggers as I would like due to the database version not allowing more than one trigger per table. This meant searching on Stack Overflow for long periods, trying to find a solution with no solution. I have accepted the triggers implemented in the tables as of right now and am going to try to create a more advanced trigger for the returns table for my ePortfolio.
